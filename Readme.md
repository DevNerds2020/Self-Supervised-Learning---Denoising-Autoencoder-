# Self-Supervised Learning: Denoising Autoencoder

This project explores the application of self-supervised learning techniques using denoising autoencoders. The primary objective is to train a model that can reconstruct original data from its corrupted versions, thereby learning meaningful representations without explicit supervision.

- `images/`: A directory to store images used in the project or README.

## Denoising Autoencoder

A denoising autoencoder is a type of neural network that learns to reconstruct data from a corrupted version of it. By doing so, the model captures the underlying structure of the data, which is beneficial for tasks like dimensionality reduction, feature learning, and data denoising.

In this project, the autoencoder is trained to remove noise from input data, effectively learning robust representations. This approach is foundational in self-supervised learning, where the model leverages the inherent structure of the data to learn without explicit labels.

## Results

The trained denoising autoencoder successfully reconstructs the original data from its noisy counterparts, demonstrating the effectiveness of self-supervised learning in capturing meaningful data representations.
